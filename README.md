# Numerical_linear_algebra
Code for the Numerical Linear Algebra project on Graphs

This repository consists of 3 ipython notebooks for:-
1) Laplacian Eigenmaps
2) Randomwalks
3) Cora_Dataset_GCNN


### Results:

Following is the visualization for the embeddings that were generated for various classes in the Numerical Linear Algebra based and the Graph Convolutional Neural Network based approaches.
